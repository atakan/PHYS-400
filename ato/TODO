-- fitting routines for data w/ y-errors.
... this will use "statistics", created by other routines
-- side 1*
-- generating data w/ x- & y-errors.
-- making fit to this data w/ AmJP method
-- making fit to this data w/ Numerical Recipes method
-- making fit to this data w/ Bayesian method.
-- making fit to this data w/ neural nets (1) recurrent (2) feed forward
using "statistics"

side 1: generating and fitting into data w/ asymmetric error bars (first
	in y, then in both directions)
