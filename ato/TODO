-- fitting routines for data w/ y-errors.
... this will use "statistics", created by other routines
-- side 1*
-- generating data w/ x- & y-errors.
-- making fit to this data w/ AmJP method
-- making fit to this data w/ Numerical Recipes method
-- making fit to this data w/ Bayesian method.
-- making fit to this data w/ neural nets (1) recurrent (2) feed forward
using "statistics"

side 1: generating and fitting into data w/ asymmetric error bars (first
	in y, then in both directions)


More: There are a lot of methods mentioned in Macdonald and Thompson
(1992, Am. J. Phys. 60, p66). Implementing them all and generalizing to
non-linear functions would easily become a master's project.

TODO for ato:
-- implementing bootstrap for uncertainties
-- implementing adoptation of NR fitting routines for Python
... both linear with two errors and general linear least squares
